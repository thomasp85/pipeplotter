Title: Syntactic ggplot2 Sugar for a Tidy World
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Thomas Lin Pedersen
Maintainer: Thomas Lin Pedersen <thomasp85@gmail.com>
Description: The success of the pipe from the magrittr pacakge (%>%) has created
    a divide between the '+' opperator in ggplot2 and the pipe used by many to
    create the data used for plotting. pipeplotter solves this by adding a thin,
    verb-based wrapper around the ggplot2 API so users can choose to keep using
    the pipe for chaining together ggplot2 operations.
